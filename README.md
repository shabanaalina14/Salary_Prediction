# Introduction

Salary prediction is a common task in the data science domain. The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately predict a person's salary based on various features such as years of experience, job role, education level, and location. The project uses machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to build and evaluate the predictive model.


# Example features in the dataset:

Years of experience
Education level
Job role
Industry
Location
Age
Gender (optional)
